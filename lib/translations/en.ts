    richtigesVorgehenText: 'The correct behavior in case of damage by the heating system operator is very important:',
    versicherungInfo: 'Depending on the weather event (flooding, lightning strike) and the resulting damage to the heating system, the corresponding insurance (household contents insurance, building insurance or in special cases natural hazard insurance) is responsible for claims settlement.',
    versicherungSofort: 'The insurance should be informed immediately. This includes documenting the damage, for example with photos or videos, and keeping the damaged items for the assessor.',
    versicherungGutachter: 'It is not unusual for the insurer to inspect the damage before settlement after a claim and only determine the further procedure and claims settlement with the insured after the inspection.',
    sachverstaendiger: 'Only a state-certified expert can assess whether a damaged part needs to be replaced or repaired; these experts are called in by the insurance companies. Whether the costs are covered also depends on the respective insurance contract. For example, surge damage must be separately included in most insurance policies.',
    servicefirma: 'As a service company or system manufacturer, we cannot create reports or check damaged parts. We also cannot comment on existing reports. We can only make a technical recommendation.',
    technischeEmpfehlung: 'Technical Recommendation',
    blitzUeberspannung: '1. Lightning and surge damage',
    blitzText1: 'Surge damage is not caused by direct lightning strike, but by overvoltage that occurred outside the building (there is not only a danger at the lightning strike location itself, but within a radius of 1.5 km due to electromagnetic fields).',
    blitzText2: 'For damage caused by lightning/overvoltage to controls, we generally recommend replacing the entire control system.',
    blitzGrund: 'Reason: It cannot be ruled out that in addition to the components obviously damaged by lightning/overvoltage, other components are also pre-damaged.',
    blitzText3: 'During troubleshooting, the components do not yet show errors, but will very likely fail at a later time. However, only an expert can make a statement about the actual damage, although it is difficult to determine lightning/surge damage on the components afterwards.',
    blitzschutzMassnahmen: 'Possible lightning protection measures',
    blitzschutzText: 'There are basically three types of lightning protection:',
    blitzschutz1: 'External protection (coarse protection) against direct lightning strikes, e.g. lightning rods.',
    blitzschutz2: 'Internal protection for the complete electrical installation through surge arresters against direct lightning strikes and overvoltages from electromagnetic fields.',
    blitzschutz3: 'Fine protection in individual electrical devices against overvoltages from electromagnetic fields.',
    blitzschutzHinweis: 'There is no hundred percent lightning protection for heating controls even when all three protective measures are implemented.',
    wasserschaeden: '2. Water damage',
    wasserText: 'With damage caused by water/moisture, it cannot be ruled out that the control is permanently damaged by oxidation and contamination.',
    wasserText2: 'The errors may not show immediately, but the control will very likely fail at a later time. In the most extreme case, it can even lead to a fire in the boiler room. Drying the components also does not rule out a possible fire.',
    wasserEmpfehlung: 'To prevent this situation, we also recommend replacing all electrical components exposed to water.',
    abrechnung: 'We can settle the damage directly with your insurer.',
